However, organizational data are often stored in digital formats that use proprietary terms, definitions, and schemas. This lack of semantic interoperability means that data exchange frequently relies on manual interpretation or custom mappings. Documents such as engineering standards, procedures, spreadsheets, and reference data libraries are prone to misinterpretation when their semantics are not formally and explicitly defined. A semantically explicit format is key to human and machine interoperability. An ontology is a structured set of terms, their interrelationships, and associated definitions, supported by formal logic to ensure that the intended meaning is unambiguous and machine-interpretable. The use of formal representation enables consistent preservation and exchange of meaning. Ontologies are increasingly integrated into enterprise architecture, particularly within knowledge management layers. An example is shown in Figure 1. The Ontology-Based interoperability (OBI) ecosystem comprises artefacts managed by ISO 23726 WG26, external organizations, enterprises, as well as organizational stakeholders, processes, and capabilities.</p> <p>Figure 1 \u2014 Example of enterprise architecture for OBI ontology-based interoperability</p> <p></p> <p>At the base of the Figure 1 is a level representing the data sources created by enterprises and stored in the data storage system layer. To organize, check, and integrate data from disparate source systems, organisations are incorporating a knowledge management layer into their enterprise architecture. An ontology-based knowledge management layer provides quality controlled, interoperable data for data products, analytics and AI used by data consumers within and across organisations. IDO is the upper ontology in the OBI ecosystem knowledge management layer. In addition to IDO the knowledge management layer includes enterprise ontologies and shared artefacts such as reference ontologies, ontology modelling patterns, templates, reference data libraries, data quality rules, SHACL shapes, and SPARQL queries. Above the knowledge management layer sits in an enterprise architecture for data products, data analytics and artificial intelligence models which are accessible to data consumers. The W3C standards Web Ontology Language (OWL) and Resource Description Framework (RDF) are foundational standards for the Semantic Web and considered normative for ontologies in the Ontology based interoperability (OBI) standards. These standards enable machine -readable, semantically interoperable representations based on shared vocabularies and logical structures. The foundation for the OBI series is ISO 23726-3, the Industrial Data Ontology (IDO). IDO specifies an abstract representation of the industrial data domain, including a high level of conceptual abstraction and associated modelling constraints. The semantic interpretation of a concept modelled according to an IDO-aligned artefact is explicitly defined. This enables consistent interpretation and automated reasoning by both humans and machines. IDO is implemented as an OWL 2 upper ontology. OWL 2 DL ontologies are interpreted using the Direct Semantics. DL (description logics) are a family of languages used in artificial intelligence and Semantic Web technologies for logic-based knowledge representation and reasoning. Typical ontology reasoning tasks include: (1) consistency checking, (2) automated classification (i.e. inferring implicit subclass hierarchies), and (3) derivation of implicit facts. OWL DL reasoners are software systems that perform these reasoning tasks automatically. Such automated reasoning is essential for quality assurance, semantic consistency, and knowledge inference within ontologies.</p>"},{"location":"#1-scope","title":"1 Scope","text":"<p>This draft provides an overview and the fundamental principles of the multipart standard ISO 23726 series Industrial automation systems and integration \u2013 Ontology based interoperability (OBI).

Ontology patterns (3.3.3) are reusable artefacts to represent structures commonly found in knowledge bases.

The benefits include reducing mapping effort, reducing potential for errors, and facilitating integration. The resulting standardization enables tooling to be built. The IDO ontology supports development of both fine and coarse grained modelling patterns. The selection of a particular level of detail is a modelling choice. High and low levels of detail in conceptual models refer to the granularity and specificity with which entities, relationships, and constraints are described. Models with high levels of detail make use fine-grained modeling patterns. These provide a verbose representation of elements in the ontology.

Data quality rules for RDF data can be expressed using languages such as (but not limited to) SHACL, SPARQL, OWL and associated reasoners. SPARQL, SHACL, and OWL are W3C standards. SPARQL (SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Languge) is used to query RDF graphs, update RDF datasets and perform federated queries across multiple endpoints. SHACL (Shapes Constraint Language) is a language for validating RDF graphs against a set of conditions. Validation is based on SHACL shapes. Each shape specifies a constraint on a class or property and identifies the class or node for which the constraint should be validated. Reasoners (e.g. HermiT, Pellet, ELK), when applied to OWL ontologies, enforce data quality rules using logical axioms defined in the ontology.</p>"},{"location":"#586-use-of-shacl","title":"5.8.6 Use of SHACL","text":"<p>OWL and SHACL are both part of the same linked data ecosystem. Both OWL and SHACL use graph\u2011shaped RDF data and are open standards, which allows them to be used across tools and vendors.  However there are differences.   1. OWL operates under the open world assumption (OWA), and SHACL under the closed world assumption (CWA).   2. OWL is descriptive, while SHACL is prescriptive.   3. OWL can be used for reasoning, and SHACL can be used for validation.</p> <p>SHACL shapes are a closed world complement to OWL and are used to enforce constraints on modelling patterns and individuals in the ontology. These constraints for example 1) make relations and its cardinalities explicit and 2) can be used for automated validation of each RDF instance in the ontology. SHACL shapes developed for reference ontologies or modelling patterns may be shared artefacts. SHACL shapes are also used by data modellers working with specific enterprise applications for quality assurance. Individual SHACL shapes can be created for different applications. SHACL shapes for application-dependent models are not usually shared outside of the enterprise. These two levels (application-independent and application dependent) are illustrated in Figure 5. The upper level of the figure shows a set of classes representing knowledge about a motor and one of its qualities (mass). In OBI a motor is a subClassOf lis:InanimatePhysicalObject and the concept of Mass is a subClassOf lis:PhysicalQuantity. These are facts and these facts are independent of a specific software application. The middle layer shows one example of instance data. In this case for ex:Motor71 with a mass of 20kg. Other attributes could include power (KW), IP rating, Noise Level (dB), and Frequency (Hz). Each will have instance data and map to classes in the top layer (not shown). A SHACL shape defined in the application-independent upper lay can be used to validate data at the instance level. For example the SHACL shape on the right hand side of the Figure 5 checks to see if 1) lis:datumUOM has exactly kilogram as unit of measurement that is a valid instance of lis:UnitOfMeasure, and 2) at least one datum value (lis:datumValue) where the datatype is xsd:float. A SHACL shape can also be used to check if an ontology is following the defined guidelines. For example, it can be checked if the shapes in Figure 5 are in line with the patterns for such shapes defined in guidelines. SHACL shapes can also be converted to OWL restrictions. The lowest level shows how data modellers building applications can use SHACL shapes to ensure that attributes of interest to a specific application are consistent with the instance data and admissible to the ontology. This is shown by the illustration of different views for a) safety engineer, and b) an electrical engineer. SHACL used in this way links the data modellers to the ontology.</p>"},{"location":"#6-fundamental-principles","title":"6 Fundamental principles","text":""},{"location":"#61-direct-semantics-consistent","title":"6.1 Direct Semantics consistent","text":"<p>Any ontology contained in the OBI series shall be compliant with OWL 2 Direct Semantics.
