# Ontology-based Interoperability

A number of organisations* involved in industrial ontology development have been supporting work to develop a proposal for ISO TC184 SC4 for a document describing an Ontology-based Interoperability ecosystem for industrial ontologies. This document will be submitted to ISO in October 2025. Once inside the ISO process only members of the ISO TC184/SC4 WG26 commmittee will have access to the document and any associated digital artefacts. 

The goal of releasing the draft document here is to provide guidance to industry users and the data modelling community about the vision for this document and more specifically about a set of principles which resources will have to comply with in order to be considered `compliant' with the ISO 23726 series.

A copy of the draft document will be uploaded to this site in early August 2025.
